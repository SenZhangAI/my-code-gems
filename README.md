## about

This repository is a collection of some awesome codes that I think is deserve to study.
Some of this codes writen by other brilliant coder, and mix with my comments(that may be a bad idea).
Some others may written by me(may be less worthy).
Some may be short, and some may be huge.
Neverthethese, I think they all have some reasons that I want to keep it.

### [EASTL]
This is **partial** source codes from the STL for Electronic Arts Inc.
This open source is incomplete and it is not a full complete implement for STL standard.
But it still worth to study because it is easy to read and more effective for Game Engine.

### GCC_STL
This is the STL source codes come from my Ubuntu 14.04 system

### [SGI_STL]
This is the SGI STL source codes.
I study it with the book ---《The Annotated STL Sources》

### ExceptionHandler
This is a implement for the exception handler by C++, they can be found in two paper

Both these paper and codes will give you a better understanding of Exception.

**Both original source codes can be downloaded at the websides links of this two paper**.

#### 1. A Crash Course on the Depths of Win32™ Structured Exception Handling
`.\src_by_Matt\` is writen by Matt Pietrek in 1997.

The relative paper is [A Crash Course on the Depths of Win32™ Structured Exception Handling](http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0197/Exception/Exception.aspx).
This paper had a deep introduction in SEH(Structued Exception Handling)

A Chinese version can be seen at [HERE](http://www.cnblogs.com/awpatp/archive/2010/06/15/1758763.html)

#### 2. How a C++ compiler implements exception handling
`.\src_by_Vishal\` is writen by Vishal Kochhar in 2002.

The relative paper is [How a C++ compiler implements exception handling](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2126/How-a-C-compiler-implements-exception-handling).
As the same of this paper's title, the paper implemet an exception handling by C++.

### [Pre-defined]
As we know, it's a hard job to move C++ project from one environment to another environment.
There are some little difference in different standards, compilers, operating systems and hardware architecture.

This is a collection of some Pre-defined Macro codes to solve these problem.
it's a little old now, the it is still a worthy template.
